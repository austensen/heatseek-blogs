Download and/or import 311 heat complaints for the 2017-2018 heat season.

```{r get-complaints}
source(here("R", "get_311_heat_complaints.R"))

complaints_raw <- get_311_heat_complaints(heat_season_start_year = 2017, data_dir = here("data"))
```

I created this lookup table to categorize complaints by resolution_description field. You can see all the details in [`data/resolution_description_lookup.csv`](data/resolution_description_lookup.csv).

```{r complaints-lookup}
res_desc_lookup <- read_csv(here("data", "resolution_description_lookup.csv"), col_types = "cc")
```

Many complaints are marked only as duplicates, and so here I assign these complaints the description of the most recent non-duplicate complaint in that BBL. There are a small number of complaints for which the description says "Violations were previously issued for these conditions", these are included in the "complaints resulting in violations" category for the stats below.

```{r clean-complaints, cache=TRUE}
complaints_clean <- complaints_raw %>% 
  filter( # 671 records dropped
    str_detect(bbl, "[1-5]\\d{9}"),
    !is.na(resolution_description)
  ) %>% 
  left_join(res_desc_lookup, by = "resolution_description") %>% 
  # Replace duplicates with the description of the most recent non-duplicate in that BBL
  group_by(bbl) %>% 
  mutate(res_desc_filled = if_else(res_desc_recode =="duplicate", NA_character_, res_desc_recode)) %>% 
  arrange(created_date, .by_group = TRUE) %>% 
  fill(res_desc_filled, .direction = "down") %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(
    viol_issued = str_detect(res_desc_recode, "(- violations)|(- previous violations)"),
    viol_issued_filled = str_detect(res_desc_filled, "(- violations)|(- previous violations)")
  )

```

Use [nyc-db](https://github.com/aepyornis/nyc-db) to pull HPD heat violations for 2017-2018 heat season. 

```{r violations, cache=TRUE}
# Load connect_nyc_db() from secret config file (see sample_config.R)
source(here("config.R"))

# Set up connection you nyc-db database
con <- connect_nyc_db()

# Use nyc-db to get count of heat violations by bbl
violations <- tbl(con, "hpd_violations") %>% 
  filter(
    sql("bbl ~ '[1-5]\\d{9}'"), # valid BBLs
    sql("novdescription ~ '27-20(2[8-9]|3[0-3])'"), # heat violations
    sql("novissueddate between '2017-10-01' and '2018-05-31'") # 2017-2018 heat season
  ) %>% 
  select(bbl, novissueddate) %>% 
  collect()

```

```{r include=FALSE}
nrow_pretty <- function(.data) {
  .data %>% nrow() %>% scales::comma() %>% str_c("**", ., "**") %>% cat()

Total heat complaints:
```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
complaints_clean %>% nrow_pretty()
```

BBLs with heat complaints:
```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
complaints_clean %>% distinct(bbl) %>% nrow_pretty()

Total heat violations:
```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
violations %>% nrow_pretty()

BBLs with heat violations:
```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}

Heat complaints tagged as resulting in violations:
```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
complaints_clean %>% filter(viol_issued) %>% nrow_pretty()

Heat complaints and their duplicates tagged as resulting in violations:
```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}

BBLs with heat complaints tagged as resulting in violations:
```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}

<br>

Heat complaints in BBLs with heat violations issued this season:
```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
complaints_clean %>% semi_join(violations, by = "bbl") %>% nrow_pretty()
```

Heat complaints in BBLs with no heat violations issued this season:
```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
complaints_clean %>% anti_join(violations, by = "bbl") %>% nrow_pretty()
```

BBLs with heat complaints but no heat violations issued this season:
```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
complaints_clean %>% distinct(bbl) %>% anti_join(violations, by = "bbl") %>% nrow_pretty()
```
